# General information about the project:
When we enter the current project, we will see two main working applications.
1. RegisterATMUsers - here you can enter the data of your existing (temporary) users. It is advisable to enter the ID in a sequential form and put a space between the first and last name, the account number should be 3 digits, and the card number should be 8. card pin must be 6 digits (otherwise we may encounter some errors in our program!). When entering the balance, remember that the value is given in dollars and enter the locked status accurately!

2. ATMApp - here you can perform temporary transactions on existing users. These operations include deposit, withdrawal, transfer, etc. includes. You can carry out operations successfully!

Note: After launching the program, you must perform all operations in one operation. If you stop using the program and decide to restart it, all your data (except the user's .txt files) will be reset. The main reason for this is that the data of logged in users is written to .txt files as a database!
