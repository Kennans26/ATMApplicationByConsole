CardNumber = 321321,
CardPin = 123123,
AccountBalance = 50000.00m,
IsLocked = false},

{Id = 2,
FullName = "Name Surname 2",
AccountNumber = 222222,
CardNumber = 654654,
CardPin = 456456,
AccountBalance = 4000.00m,
IsLocked = false},

{Id = 3,
FullName = "Name Surname 3",
AccountNumber = 333333,
CardNumber = 987987,
CardPin = 789789,
AccountBalance = 2000.00m,
